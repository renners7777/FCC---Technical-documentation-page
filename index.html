                                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a <em>markup language</em> that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.
                                It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which
                                you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing
                                tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the
                                following line of text:</p>
                                <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
                                <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a <code><span class="token-punctuation"><</span>p<span class="token-punctuation">></span></code> element:</p>   
                                <code><span class="token-punctuation"><</span>p<span class="token-punctuation">></span>My cat is very grumpy<span class="token-punctuation"><</span>/p<span class="token-punctuation">></span></code>

                                    Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:</p>
                                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="grumpy cat code example" title="Grumpy cat code example" width="400px" height="200px"></a>
                                <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
                                    <li>The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
                                    <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>

                                <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
                                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="attribute image" title="attribute example" width="400px" height="100px">
                                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the <code><i>class</i></code> attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.</p>
                                <p>An attribute should have:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
                                    <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                                    <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making comments invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long enough that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are making changes and updates.</p>
                                <p>Comments should be placed within special characters, such as <code><\!--'Comments here' --></code>. The "\" in the code sequence here is an escape character.</p>

                                <p>You made it to the end of the article! We hope you enjoyed your tour of the basics of HTML.</p>
                                <p>At this point, you should understand what HTML looks like, and how it works at a basic level. You should also be able to write a few elements and attributes. The subsequent articles of this module go further on some of the topics introduced here, as well as presenting other concepts of the language.</p>
